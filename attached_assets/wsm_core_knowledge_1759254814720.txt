WSM (Weyl State Machine) Core Knowledge Base

=== FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ===

The Weyl State Machine (WSM) represents a revolutionary post-LLM architecture that transcends traditional statistical correlation approaches through mathematical rigor based on quantum mechanics and symplectic geometry.

Core Mathematical Foundation:
- Weyl operators: W(ξ) = exp(i(ξ_Q Q + ξ_P P)/ℏ)
- Hadamard shifts: e^A Q e^{-A} = Q + ξ_P, e^A P e^{-A} = P - ξ_Q
- Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH): W(ξ)W(ζ) = e^{-iσ(ξ,ζ)/(2ℏ)} W(ξ+ζ)
- Symplectic structure preservation through Sp(2n) transformations

=== WSM ARCHITECTURE ===

State Evolution:
- State μ ∈ ℝ^{2n}, update μ' = S(u)μ + ξ(u), S ∈ Sp(2n)
- Symplectic transitions via 'expm' or 'cayley' methods for stability
- Non-Gaussian residual components for enhanced expressivity

Model Components:
- SymplecticLayer with Hamiltonian networks H_net and displacement networks ξ_net
- Omega matrix Ω for symplectic structure preservation
- Cayley map or matrix exponential for symplectic transformations

=== CAUSAL LATTICE RESONANCE (CLR) COMPUTING ===

CLR Computing operates on potentiality fields of causal connections rather than step-by-step simulation:

Fundamental Primitives:
- QuantumField with interaction_metric: {field_strength, spin_correlation}
- InformationUnit with coherence_metric: {bit_state, entanglement_potential}

SystemLattice Structure:
- Nodes: Heterogeneous fundamental entities
- Causal channels: Dynamic potential connections based on global state metrics
- Entropic selection for stable, self-reinforcing causal patterns

Entropic Causal Selection Principle:
- Identifies local minima in combined causal entropy and informational entropy
- Selects configurations with high causal connectivity density
- Requires informational coherence above threshold
- Minimizes entropic instability potential

=== HARMONIC UNIFICATION STACK (HUS) ===

The HUS provides a comprehensive framework integrating:
- Photoreal rendering capabilities

=== QUANTUM GRAVITY CONNECTIONS ===

WSM incorporates quantum gravity concepts through:
- Holographic tensor networks (HaPPY/MERA) for bulk-boundary correspondence

- Replica wormhole signatures through permutation correlators

Black Hole Information Dynamics:
- Infalling qubit reconstructability from Hawking-like emissions
- Island transition identification through entanglement measures
- Finite-size scaling for critical exponent extraction
